High-contrast black & white photo in a modern art gallery. Candid "stolen shot" of a young woman standing still  among a blurred moving crowd. Slightly slanted angle, face partly turned (not fully side view/camera). 3/4 body shot  (mid-thigh up). Wearing a long dark coat, hands in pockets. Behind her: framed Banksy artworks arranged in a grid
